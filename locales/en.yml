      left: |
        Tellida is a Shopify app that you can install on your existing store. It will first ask you to connect your Stripe account, and link your subscription products to Stripe Plans. They support coupons, complex plan schemes etc ..
      right: |
        When a customer purchases a subscription product, he will experience a native Shopify checkout. The only difference is that his payment infos will be stored in your Stripe account, and he will be subscribed to the plan. His credit card will then be charged regularly, depending on your plan.
